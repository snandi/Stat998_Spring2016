\section*{Goal}
Use of insecticide sprays are detrimental to the survival of honeybees. Scientists are trying to improve their understanding of these side effects of insecticides. Reports from warmer weather areas suggest that the insecticide ``Permethrin'' (PER) has less harmful effects on honeybees. There is reason to believe that some antioxidants could counteract the negative effect of insecticide. The primary goal of this study is to determine which of the six antioxidants, if any, shows any honeybee reduction in honeybee mortality, by negating the effects of PER. 

\section*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What was the rationale behind exposing the containers to colder temperature only for one day?
\item Why is mortality rates between days 4 and 6 most important? Does it have anything to do with the cold temperature exposure?
\item Is there any literature on inherent toxic effects of the antioxidants?
\item Why were they observed for that long periods?
\item What if the effects of PER and that of the antioxidants have different rates? The antioxidants do seem to have inherent toxic effects, but slower than that of PER.
\item Based on the total number of honeybees that died, the initial numbers that each container started off with vary between 23 and 66. Were the amounts of antioxidants sprayed/fed changed accordingly? Would that matter? Since the amount of antioxidants per bee will be different.
\end{enumerate}
