\section*{Summary}\label{Sec_Summary}

\section*{Data exploration} \label{Sec_Data}
Before analyzing the data, the missing value for the variable ``Days\_In\_Milk'' was imputed by fitting a linear model between cow characteristics and ``Days\_In\_Milk''. The imputed value was $29.2126$. The details of this model fit is discussed in the Appendix. 

\section*{Statistical methodology} \label{Sec_Methods}
We used the ``Partial least square (PLS) regression'' \cite{Mevik_Wehrens_2007_JSS} to reduce the number of covariates.

\noindent
To impute the missing value for ``Days\_In\_Milk'', the following linear model was fit:
\[ \text{Dry\_Matter\_Intake} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{BodyWeight} + \beta_2 \text{Body\_Condition\_Score} + \beta_3 \text{Parity} + \beta_4 \text{Milk\_Yield}  \]
Below are the coefficients. The overall $R^2 = 0.49$. The imputed value for Dry\_Matter\_Intake was $29.2126$.
