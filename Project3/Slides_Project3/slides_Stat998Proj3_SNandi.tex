\frametitle{Registration details}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x(t)$ be the true curve; $y(t)$ be the curve to register. 
\item Let $h(t)$ be the warping function; $y[h(t)]$ be the registered curve.
\item $y[h(t)]$ and and $x(t)$ differ only in terms of amplitude variation, i.e., their values are proportional to one another across the range of $t$
\item Then, PCA of the following order two matrix should reveal essentially one component (smallest eigen value $\approx 0$) \\
\[C(h) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\int \{x(t) \}^2dt & \int x(t) y[h(t)]dt \vspace{0.5cm} \\ 
\int x(t) y[h(t)]dt & \int \{y[h(t)]\}^2dt
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\item Choose $h(t)$ that minimizes the eigen value
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Estimation of the warping function}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $h(t)$ is a strictly {\emph{monotone increasing}} function; Hence {\emph{invertible}}.
\item Let $w(t) = \frac{h''(t)}{h'(t)}$ be the relative acceleration of the warping function. \\
This will be used to {\emph{constrain}} the warping
\item The objective function is 
\[ \text{MINEIG}_{\lambda}(h) = \text{MINEIG}(h) + \lambda \int \{w^{(m)}(t)\}^2 dt \]
which is similar to:
\[ F_{\lambda}(y,x|h) = \int \|y'(t) - x'\{h(t)\} \|^2 dt + \lambda \int \{w^{(m)}(t)\}^2 dt \]
Penalizing $w(t)$ ensures smoothness and monotonicity
\item Express $w(t)$ in terms of B-Spline expansion: 
\[w(t) = \sum \limits_{k=0}^{K} c_k B_k(t)\]
Solve for the coefficients $c_k$
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Functional regression framework}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Response: ASD $y$; Covariate: SE $w$; Abscissa: Wavelength $x$
\item Basis expansion representation of $w$:
\[w(x) = \sum \limits_{j=0}^{q} c_j z_j(x)\]
Choice of basis: B-spline or PCA basis
\item For leaf $i$, the concurrent multiple regression model is:
\[ y_i(x) = \sum \limits_{j=0}^{q} z_{ij}(x)\beta_j(x) + \epsilon_i(x) \]
\item In matrix form
\[ \mathbf{y}(x) = \mathbf{Z}(x)\mathbf{\beta}(x) + \mathbf{\epsilon}(x)\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item Choose the appropriate basis expansion for the functions
\item Fit ASD spectroscopic values to SE values using functional regression
\item Calibration function: Convolution of warping function from registration and fit from the regression model
\item Estimate and compare prediction error before and after calibration 
\item Use ``species'' as a random effect if desired
