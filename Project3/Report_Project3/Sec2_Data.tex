\section*{Exploratory Analysis} \label{Sec_Data}

As mentioned in section \ref{Sec_Summary} the total yield and several chemical compositions of the biomass are of interest. Table \label{Tab:Tab1} displays the correlation coefficients between these response variables. Notice that ``Height'' and ``Stem Count'' are both statistically significantly correlated (p-value $\sim 0$) with ``Yield''. ``CP'' is the only response that is not significantly correlated with anything other than ``Stem Count''.
