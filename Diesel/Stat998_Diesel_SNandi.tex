\section*{Goal}
The investigator wished to learn how the iginition delay in a diesel engine is affected by four experimental variables: speed of engine, load on engine, percentage of alcohol in the fuel, and injection timing. This relationship should be derived accounting for the fact that ignition delay is already related to temperature and pressure by a proposed model \\
$\text{ignition delay} = AP^{-n}e^{E/RT}$

\section*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Were these different runs independent?
\item How were the measurements recorded? Same engine, multiple times? If yes, then what was the gap between two runs?
\item Temperature and Pressure seem to be strongly correlated. Are both of them important to be in the model?
\item Pressure is strongly dependent on the load. 
\end{enumerate}
