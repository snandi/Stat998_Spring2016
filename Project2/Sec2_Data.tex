\section*{Exploratory Analysis} \label{Sec_Data}

As mentioned in section \ref{Sec_Summary} the total yield and several chemical compositions of the biomass are of interest. Table \label{Tab:Tab1} displays the correlation coefficients between these response variables. Notice that ``Height'' and ``Stem Count'' are both statistically significantly correlated (p-value $\sim 0$) with ``Yield''. ``CP'' is the only response that is not significantly correlated with anything other than ``Stem Count''.

Below are some exploratory plots of yield and other factors like ``sorghum type'' and ``vegetation type''.

From fig \ref{fig:Fig1} it is not quite evident if the two types of sorghums, ``PS'' and ``Sweet'' have different yields. However, the yield in 2015 seems higher than that in 2014.

\caption{Yield vs sorghum subtypes and location}
\label{fig:Fig2}
\end{figure}

Fig \ref{fig:Fig2} shows that the different locations may not result in different average yields, but might result in different variability. It also shows that the ``PS'' subtype TX13001 shows higher yields compared to PS subtype TX08001. The two ``Sweet'' subtypes do not exhibit much difference. Although the subtypes were believed to produced similar yields, it is worth testing for the difference based on the boxplot above.
